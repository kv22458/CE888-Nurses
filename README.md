Stress Detection using Wearable Sensor Data
This project focuses on predicting stress levels using data collected from wearable devices, such as smartwatches. The wearable devices measure heart rate, skin response (EDA), and movement (accelerometer) to determine stress levels. We evaluated various machine learning algorithms to find the most accurate models for this purpose.

Overview
The repository contains code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The main machine learning algorithms explored in this project are:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
k-NN
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
XGBoost
Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Results
Our study demonstrates that wearable devices can be used to predict stress levels by measuring heart rate, skin response, and movement. The most accurate models in predicting stress were Random Forest and k-NN. This project paves the way for the development of a stress detection system for hospitals and helps the company maintain its position as a leader in wearable technology innovation.
