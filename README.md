    <h1>Stress Detection using Wearable Sensor Data</h1>
    <p>This project focuses on predicting stress levels using data collected from wearable devices, such as smartwatches. The wearable devices measure heart rate, skin response (EDA), and movement (accelerometer) to determine stress levels. We evaluated various machine learning algorithms to find the most accurate models for this purpose.</p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The repository contains code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The main machine learning algorithms explored in this project are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Logistic Regression</li>
        <li>Random Forest</li>
        <li>k-NN</li>
        <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
        <li>XGBoost</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
        <li>Install the required Python libraries using <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>.</li>
        <li>Ensure you have the dataset available in the correct format (as described in the code).</li>
        <li>Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the order provided.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>merge_scripts/</code>: Script bundles for data cleaning, preprocessing, and merging.</li>
        <li><code>multi_model.ipynb, multi_model_xgboost.ipynb</code>: Notebook for training and evaluating different machine learning models.</li>
        <li><code>timeseries.ipynb</code>: Notebook for time series analysis of the sensor data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Our study demonstrates that wearable devices can be used to predict stress levels by measuring heart rate, skin response, and movement. The most accurate models in predicting stress were Random Forest and k-NN. This project paves the way for the development of a stress detection system for hospitals and helps the company maintain its position as a leader in wearable technology innovation.</p>
